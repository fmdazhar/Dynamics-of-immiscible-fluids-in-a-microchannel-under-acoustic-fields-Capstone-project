In this work, by using the expression for acoustic force density fac for inhomogeneous fluid using time averaged perturbation theory, we have presented theoretical evidence for the relocation of high concentration immiscible fluid in low concentration medium. The same has been studied and verified for various initial configurations in the COMSOL multi-physics software. We have found critical Eac values for different interfacial tension various differences in density and sound velocity by simulation.
We also then study the droplet deformation in an immiscible host fluid by simulations and observe the effects of acoustic radiation pressure upon the droplet surface. Finally, non-dimensionalization of droplet deformation in x axis is done, keeping acoustic force density and force due to interfacial tension in mind. This paves way route to acoustics based interfacial tensiometry, which is used for measuring interfacial tension between fluids when traditional methods would be difficult to implement.
Our thesis opens a new branch of potential application in interfacial tensiometry using manipulation with acoustic fields. This method will permit the measurement of interfacial tension when traditional methods are difficult to implement. This technique can be directly applied to measurement of interfacial tension property of liquid droplets in their stable state.
